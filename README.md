# ts-react-lib-starter-kit (yarn-pnp)

**_NOTE: This branch uses Yarn2 with PnP so you need to configure your editor. I already added some configs for vscode and vim. To configure other editors use Yarn2 SDK from the [docs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks). For For example if you using JetBrains IDE you can find example repo with configuration like [this](https://github.com/clianor/yarn2-example-with-intellij)_**

Starter kit for UI library based on React.

Most of the components could be replaced or removed. For example you can replace Cypress with Jest. The main goal is to show how to configure and use modern frontend stack.
