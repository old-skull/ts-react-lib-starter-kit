# ts-react-lib-starter-kit (yarn-pnp)

**_NOTE: This branch uses Yarn2 with PnP as package manager so you need to configure your editor. There is configs for vscode and vim. To configure other editors use Yarn2 SDK from the [docs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/editor-sdks). For example if you are using JetBrains IDE you can check example repo with configuration [here](https://github.com/clianor/yarn2-example-with-intellij). Or checkout to the other branch._**

Most of the components could be replaced or removed. For example you can replace Cypress with Jest. The main goal is to show how to configure and use modern frontend stack.
